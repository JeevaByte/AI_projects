# Hybrid Cloud Hosting Platform for WordPress (Project Plan)

## Overview
This project aims to build a scalable, resilient hybrid-cloud hosting platform for thousands of WordPress sites, leveraging cPanel/WHM for web server management and Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database operations. Infrastructure will be provisioned on DigitalOcean using Terraform, with automation via Ansible.

## Project Execution Workflow

### 1. Requirement Analysis Phase
- System Action: Analyze requirements and identify key components, constraints, and deliverables (Completed)
- Manual Action: Human review and clarification (Completed)

### 2. Planning Phase
- System Action: Create this project plan (README.md)
- Manual Action: Human validation and approval to proceed (Required)

### 3. Validation & Improvement Phase
- System Action: Self-review of plan, identify improvements/gaps
- Manual Action: Human review and approval

### 4. Design Phase
- System Action: Create architecture diagram, sequence diagrams, class diagrams (if applicable)
- System Action: Establish organized folder structure for all artifacts
- Manual Action: Human review and approval of diagrams

### 5. Implementation Phase
- System Action: Create code files (Terraform, Ansible, Supabase integration, monitoring setup)
- System Action: Create dependency/config files
- System Action: Implement deployment configuration
- System Action: Implement testing framework and tests

### 6. Validation Phase
- System Action: Verify requirements, confirm files, run tests
- Manual Action: Human validation of completed project

### 7. Documentation Phase
- System Action: Create MANUAL_ACTIONS.md and finalize documentation

### 8. Repository Setup Phase
- System Action: Initialize git repository, add/commit files
- Manual Action: Provide repository destination for code push

### 9. Completion Phase
- System Action: Display completion message and access instructions

## Manual Actions Required
1. Review and approve project plan
2. Provide clarification on ambiguous requirements
3. Review and approve design diagrams
4. Provide repository destination for code push
5. Final validation of completed project

## Improvement Feedback Mechanism
- System Action: Analyze improvements after each project
- System Action: Update template based on lessons learned
- Manual Action: Human review of template improvements
